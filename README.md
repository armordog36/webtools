# My Webtools Class Project

This project was created as part of the Launch Studio coursework at Dallas College. It demonstrates the foundations of semantic HTML5, proper file organization, and site structure for a multi-page website.

The website introduces me, Gaushik Gounder, and documents the start of my web development journey. It follows industry best practices like semantic layout, clean navigation, and consistent design across multiple pages.
