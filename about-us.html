      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        At <strong>Launch Studio</strong>, we believe learning web development should feel like
        stepping into your first professional role. Think of us as a creative workspace
        where students transform curiosity into real-world skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aren’t just building websites — we’re building confidence, collaboration,
        and career-ready habits. Every project you tackle here is designed to feel
        like an authentic assignment you might receive from a client or supervisor
        in the field.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        To provide aspiring developers with hands-on, project-based experiences that
        bridge the gap between classroom learning and professional practice.
      </p>

      <h3>What We Do</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a studio-like environment where students work on real-world challenges.</li>
        <li>Encourage problem-solving, debugging, and documentation as everyday habits.</li>
        <li>Connect tools like <code>VS Code</code>, <code>GitHub</code>, and modern web frameworks to authentic
          workflows.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>
        The web is constantly evolving, and so are we. By practicing in Launch Studio,
        students don’t just learn <em>what</em> to code — they learn <em>how</em> to
        think like developers, adapt to new tools, and collaborate effectively.
