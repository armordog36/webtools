      <p>
        My name is Gaushik Gounder, and I’m currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Applied Technology in Software
        Development program at Dallas College. I’ve always been interested in how things work and function — especially
        technology —
        and this degree is helping me turn that interest into a valuable career path.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of academics, I enjoy a wide range of activities that help me stay balanced and connected. I’m a big fan
        of <em>basketball and sports</em> in general, whether I’m watching games or playing with friends. I also spend
        time gaming, watching movies and TV shows, and hanging out with family and friends. These hobbies not only help
        me relax but also fuel my creativity and problem-solving mindset.

      <h3 id="developer-identity">Developer Identity</h3>
      <p>
        As a future software developer, I see myself as a creative and logical thinker. I’m drawn to the way web
        development blends technical skill with creativity. It’s amazing how a few lines of code can create something
        interactive and meaningful. I’m currently building a strong foundation in HTML and plan to expand my skills into
        CSS, JavaScript, and full-stack development.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t use an avatar for this course, but if I had to describe myself in developer terms, I’d say I’m a
        learner-driven builder. I approach problems with patience and curiosity, always trying to improve. My goal is
        not just to build websites, but to design experiences that are accessible, intuitive, and impactful. I believe
        that being a great developer is about more than just syntax — it's about <strong>empathy, design thinking, and
          continuous learning</strong>.
      </p>

    <section id="learning-journey">
      <h3 id="learning-journey">Learning Journey</h3>
      <p>
        I enrolled in this course to gain real-world skills in web development and build a career in tech. I’ve always
        been interested in computers, but I never really understood how websites were built until I started learning
        HTML. Seeing how everything comes together — from structure to interaction — has been incredibly rewarding.
      </p>
      <a href = "images/learning.png" target = "_blank">
        <img src="images/learning-md.png" class="fluid" alt="Learning Journey" >
      <p>
        I’m excited to continue learning and eventually work on projects that involve building complete web
        applications. I want to explore areas like responsive design, APIs, user authentication, and possibly mobile
        development. Most importantly, I want to become confident in my ability to contribute to a professional
        development team and bring value through my skills.
